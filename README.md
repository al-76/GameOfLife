# Conway's Game of Life
This is an implementation of the Game of Life by the British mathematician John Horton Conway.

It's a zero-player game (or cellular automata) that has simple rules:
- A live cell that has two or three live neighbors lives
- A dead cell that has three live neighbors becomes life
- Other cells are dead

However, it generates lots of different interesting patterns.
For example:
- Still Lifes (that aren't changed)
- Oscillators (that oscillate)
- Spaceships (that move and hold their form)

The details can be found here - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life

My implementation is quite easy (iOS, Swift, SpriteKit, Perlin noise), and I did it just for fun.
And partially, as nostalgia about times when I read this book - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hackers:_Heroes_of_the_Computer_Revolution :)
